# Movie_Trailer_Website
The files necessary to create the Movie Trailer Website from Udacity's Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree.

#### As the title and description suggest, this is a project that is focused on meeting the requirements of the Udacity Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree's "Create a Movie Trailer Website" project.
    
This "program" uses multiple .py files to generate a website currently consisting of six (6) movie trailers.
This number can be scaled by adding to the "entertainment_center.py" file.

### How it works

#### There are three (3) main files used in this project:

    * fresh_tomatoes.py - Provided by Udacity to generate the website, with minor edits to add ratings and scores.
    
    * media.py - Created for the sake of creating the "Movie" class.
    
    * entertainment_center.py - Created to leverage the Movie class and enter the details needed to populate the site.

* To add movies to the site, edit entertainment_center.py with the title, storyline, poster URL, trailer URL, critical score, and rating.

### Running the application

* To run the application, simply place the three (3) files into a single folder, and execute the ____entertainment_center.py____ file.  This will run the application, gather the information on your movies, and generate/open the newly created "fresh tomatoes" html file in your browser.
